# Design and Implementation of High Speed ADC Card using ADC10080 and STM32F3 Discovery
 
 This repository contains the STM32 code for the high-speed analog-to-digital converter (ADC) card designed and implemented as part of my graduation project. The code is written for the STM32F3 Discovery microcontroller and the ADC10080 component, and it enables the card to sample signals at a rate of 80 MHz. The code includes the initialization of the microcontroller, the configuration of the ADC, and the implementation of the data acquisition and processing functions.
